## Texture or Taste Issues

Texture and taste problems often stem from storage or reheating. Follow these steps to resolve them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Storage" icon="package">
    Ensure you store pouches in a cool, dry place below `25°C`. Avoid direct sunlight or refrigerators if unopened, as condensation can affect texture.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect Expiry" icon="calendar">
    Verify the best-before date on the pouch. Use within `7 days` after opening, refrigerated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Taste" icon="spice">
    For bland Kerala fish curry, add a pinch of `salt` and `fresh lime`. Stir in `coconut milk` for creamier texture in vegetable thoran.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Taste develops after reheating. Let meals rest `2 minutes` post-heating for authentic ethnic flavors.
